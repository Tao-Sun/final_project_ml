\section{Conclusion}

In this project, a new model is proposed to classify subjects with AD and NC subjects. Specially, we devise a hybrid architecture by involving RNN into the final decision process. To overcome the constraints of limited data, the high dimensional data output by the previous step is splitted into multiple identical-sized segments. We evaluates the performance of the proposed and analyzed several influential tuning decisions. As part of our future work, we hope to substitute the overlapping sliding window for identical-sized segments to further improve the performance of our model.
